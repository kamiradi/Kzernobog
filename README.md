### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a robotics researcher at the University of Edinburgh focussing on Robot Learning. I am associated with the [Robust Autonomy Decisions](https://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/) group. Previously, I have worked as a Systems Engineer in the simulation industry. I hope to get started on open source projects. If you have anything in mind, do drop a message.
